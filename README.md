This project is an audiovisual interactive composition. The final result is the audio frequency change as the music change. Let people feeling visual and auditory shock. This project used Javascript, three.js, WebGL as well as techniques for user interaction. I refer some examples in three.js and change some coding about color and  motion track. This is my first time to finished homework independently. Maybe the work is not so amazing, but I spent a lot of time studying online and trying my best to do it.
